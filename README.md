 Fox Hunt transmitter controller with DTMF remote commands

 * Designed to run on a small ATtiny85 board such as Digispark or similer.   
 * Requires tinyDTMF library (https://github.com/bratoff/tinyDTMF)   
 * Requires an Arduino core with a fine-granularity, accurate implementation of micros().  I use this one:  https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore   

 Complete documentation can be found in the source code.
